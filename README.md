# The_repressilator
 Model analysis to Explore the Behaviour of the Repressilator from simulation using an ODE model The repressilator system is formed of three genes, which code for a specific protein via initial formation of a mRNA transcript. We have six components to model for the repressilator network. A system of ordinary differential equations is used to model the repressilator network. The model includes both mrnA and protein species for each gene due to the fact that the genes act as transcriptional repressors and so repress the production of mRNA. By including mRNA in the model we can see the repression strength of each gene and also allows the further integration of mRNA degradation rate into the mathematical modelling to increase the accuracy of the model. In physical modelling, Green Flouorsecent Protein (GFP) has been used to demonstrate sustanined oscillatonbs in the repressilator network as the concentration of GFP also oscilated under the negative transcriptional control of the TetR protein. The emergence of a limit cycle, a specific trajectory found in non-linear systems and significant in network dynacis, is the underlying cause of the sustained oscillations produced by the repressilator system.
